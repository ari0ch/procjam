procjam
=======

This game (a roguelike) was built for [#procjam 2014](http://itch.io/jam/procjam). Procjam is a game jam about procedural generation.

The levels in this game are generated procedurally. You can customise a number of parameters directly on the page and see the effect they have on the level generation.
